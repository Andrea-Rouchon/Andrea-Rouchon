# Hello and welcome! 👋🏻

## 🌱 Background

I arrived in Paris in 2019 with a simple plan: study economics. But somewhere between development theory and my first econometrics class, something shifted. I realised that what fascinated me most was not abstract models, but the stories hidden in data — the quiet patterns that explain how societies grow, adapt, and sometimes fracture. My first research project on climate-driven migration confirmed it: I wanted to understand the world through evidence.

As I moved into my Master’s studies, institutions and firm behaviour became my compass. A thesis on firm-level debt and growth led me to the Érudite research lab, where I discovered the pace, patience, and curiosity of academic work. I continued to refine my interests during a second Master’s at Université Gustave Eiffel, where another research project helped me articulate the questions that mattered most to me.

Slowly, almost unexpectedly, everything pointed toward China. Its sweeping 2012 anti-corruption campaign, its remarkable growth despite deep institutional frictions, its unusual balance between central authority and regional autonomy — it all felt like a perfect storm of economic and political forces. The more I explored it, the more it became clear that this was the landscape where my research truly belonged.

And that is where I stand now: a PhD Candidate in Economics at the Érudite research laboratory, Université Gustave Eiffel, trying to shed light on the complex ties between corruption, institutions, and economic development.

## 📚 Doctoral Research

**Thesis title:** *Corruption and Economic Distorsions: The Example of China*  
**Supervisors:** Mélika Ben Salem and Marin Ferry  
**Laboratory:** Érudite, Université Gustave Eiffel

My doctoral project studies the Chinese anti-corruption campaign launched in 2012 and its implications for firm performance and economic distortions. The research relies on large-scale firm-level data and applied econometric strategies, including difference-in-differences in standard and staggered configurations. Beyond the empirical contribution, the project aims to better understand how the interaction between a centralised political structure and a decentralised economic system shapes firms’ behaviour and regional development trajectories.
