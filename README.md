## About Me

I am a PhD Candidate in Applied Economics at Érudite (Université Gustave Eiffel), where I began my doctorate on 1 September 2025. My research examines the economic costs of corruption through the case of China, with a particular focus on how institutional environments and anti-corruption policies affect firm behaviour, investment structures, market power, and innovation.

My academic trajectory has gradually evolved toward development economics, political economy, and applied microeconometrics. After a Bachelor’s degree and a research-oriented Master’s programme at Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne, I joined the Master 2 *Development Economics & International Project Management* at Université Gustave Eiffel. Across these programmes, I conducted several empirical research projects relying on firm-level and institutional data, which ultimately led me to formalize my doctoral project.

I completed two long research internships at Érudite under the supervision of Marin Ferry, where I strengthened my interest in data-intensive research, impact evaluation methods, and the empirical analysis of institutions. I also gained teaching experience as a teaching assistant in undergraduate economics.

I work in French (native) and English (fluent). I can be reached at: **andrea.rouchon2@gmail.com**.

## Current PhD Project

**Thesis title:** *Corruption and Economic Distorsions: The Example of China*  
**Supervisors:** Mélika Ben Salem and Marin Ferry  
**Laboratory:** Érudite, Université Gustave Eiffel

My doctoral research studies the Chinese anti-corruption campaign launched in 2012 and its implications for firm performance and economic distortions. The project builds on large-scale firm-level data and relies on applied econometric approaches, including difference-in-differences strategies in standard and staggered settings. Beyond the empirical contribution, the objective is to shed light on how the interaction between a centralised political structure and a decentralised economic system shapes firms’ behaviour and local development trajectories.
